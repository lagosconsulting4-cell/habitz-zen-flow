description: Conduct a pragmatic code review of pending changes

I'll analyze the changes on your current branch using our pragmatic code review agent. This will evaluate architecture, functionality, security, maintainability, testing, performance, and dependencies.

Launch the @agent-pragmatic-code-review subagent to begin the comprehensive review.
